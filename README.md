# Customer Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

An interactive **Customer Analytics Dashboard** built with **Power BI** to visualize customer demographics, perform **RFM analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), and support data-driven marketing campaigns.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to design and develop an **interactive dashboard** that helps businesses:

- **Understand customer demographics** – visualize sales by gender, age group, marital status, and geography.  
- **Segment customers with RFM analysis** – classify them into meaningful groups (Champions, Loyal, At Risk, Lost, etc.).  
- **Support targeted marketing campaigns** – identify high-value customers and plan data-driven strategies.  
- **Enable drill-through analysis** – view detailed customer-level data for deeper insights.  
- **Improve decision-making** – by presenting clean, actionable, and visually appealing analytics in a single report.
